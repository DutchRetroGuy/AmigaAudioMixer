; Configuration defines
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Mixer type selection
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Set one of the defines below to 1 to select the desired mixer type:
; (note that only the code required for the selected type will end up in the
;  object file, with specific optimisations for each type as required)
;
; * MIXER_SINGLE		- mixer outputs to a single hardware channel.
;
; * MIXER_MULTI 		- mixer outputs to multiple hardware channels.
;
;						  Each hardware channel gets its own set of software
;						  mixed channels.
;
; * MIXER_MULTI_PAIRED	- mixer outputs to multiple hardware channels.
;
;						  Hardware channels are split into one pair of 
;						  channels and between zero and two unpaired channels.
;
;						  The paired hardware channels both play back the same
;						  set of software mixed channels. The unpaired channels
;						  (if any) each get their own set of software mixed 
;						  channels. 
;
;						  The paired channels will always be AUD2 & AUD3.
;						  Unpaired channels are either none, AUD0, AUD1 or 
;						  AUD0 & AUD1.
MIXER_SINGLE			EQU 1
MIXER_MULTI				EQU	0
MIXER_MULTI_PAIRED		EQU 0


;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Mixer mode selection
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Set define below to 1 to enable the high quality mixer routines. The high 
; quality mixer routines do not require pre-processed samples, allowing for
; full 8-bit quality to be used. However, the high quality mixer routines use
; considerably more CPU time to do the mixing.
MIXER_HQ_MODE			EQU	1


;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Mixer output configuration
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
mixer_output_channels	EQU	DMAF_AUD2
									; valid values are DMAF_AUD0/1/2/3 or
									; any bitwise combination of these with at
									; least one channel set.
									;
									; Note: combining channels is only
									;       valid when MIXER_MULTI or
									;       MIXER_MULTI_PAIRED is set.
									; Note: if MIXER_MULTI_PAIRED is set,
									;       valid combinations are:
									;       * DMAF_AUD2|DMAF_AUD3
									;       * DMAF_AUD2|DMAF_AUD3|DMAF_AUD0
									;       * DMAF_AUD2|DMAF_AUD3|DMAF_AUD1
									;		* all 4 channels
									
mixer_sw_channels		EQU	4		; Maximum number of software mixed 
									; channels on a single hardware channel.
									; Valid values are 1,2,3 and 4
mixer_period			EQU	322 	; Valid values: 124 and up
									; Default value of 322 is about
									; 11025Hz when using a PAL Amiga
									;
									; Note: there are minor differences in 
									;       period values between PAL and NTSC
									;       for the same desired output 
									;       frequency.
									;
									;       These differences are not taken 
									;       into account, the value set here 
									;       is used as the actual HW period 
									;       value for the mixer, irrespective
									;       of the video system of the Amiga 
									;       the mixer is running on.
									
MIXER_PER_IS_NTSC		EQU	0		; Set to 1 if the mixer period value set
									; above is given for NTSC systems, leave 
									; at 0 if it is given for PAL systems.


;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Optimisation related options
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Set define below to 1 to optimise mixer code for the 68020+.
; If set to 0, optimised code for 68000 is used instead.
;
; Note: code generated will run on 68000/68010 and 68020+ irrespective of this
;       setting, the only difference is one of speed - the 68000 code is
;       significantly faster on 68000/68010 than the 68020+ code and
;       vice versa.
MIXER_68020				EQU 0

; Optimisations below only apply to the 68000 version, as they will not
; improve performance for 68020+ code/machines.

; Set define below to 1 to optimise the mixer by limiting maximum sample
; length to 65532 bytes (technically up to 65535, but the mixer always rounds
; lengths down to the nearest multiple of 4 bytes). This increases performance
; by switching some operations from being longword based to word based.
MIXER_WORDSIZED			EQU 0

; Set define below to 1 to optimise the mixer by forcing both the buffer size
; and source sample sizes to be multiples of 32 bytes. This improves
; performance slightly by removing the need to deal with samples that are a 
; multiple of 4 bytes in size.
;
; Note: the amount of performance gained this way will be dependend on the 
;       calculated buffer size for the chosen period - if this buffer size is 
;       already a multiple of 32, the performance gain will be very limited or
;       non-existent.
; Note: irrespective of the calculated buffer size, the possible gain for this
;       option is usually limited.
MIXER_SIZEX32			EQU 0

; Set define below to 1 to optimise the mixer by forcing the source sample 
; size to always be a multiple of the buffer size. This increases performance
; significantly by removing the need to decide the correct number of bytes to
; mix.
;
; Note: this setting adapts to the video system selected at runtime using the
;       MixerSetup() routine and will use an appropriate buffer size to keep
;       the interrupt running once per frame for both PAL and NTSC based 
;       displays.
; Note: off all the performance options for the 68000 code, this will give the
;       largest performance gain, at the cost of needing (potentially
;       significantly) more memory for samples.
; Note: if both this and MIXER_SIZEX32 are set, the buffer size will be a
;       multiple of 32 bytes.
; Note: the combination of MIXER_SIZEX32 and MIXER_SIZEXBUF does not normally
;       increase performance meaningfully - selecting MIXER_SIZEXBUF will
;       mostly make MIXER_SIZEX32 irrelevant. However, in some edge cases,
;       it can still create a slight increase in performance over just using
;       MIXER_SIZEXBUF.
; Note: if this option is set to one, the setting for MIXER_HQ_MODE is 
;       ignored.
MIXER_SIZEXBUF			EQU 0


;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Performance measurement options
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Set define below to 1 to enable colour/timing bars
MIXER_TIMING_BARS		EQU	1
; Set to desired background colour to reset to after colour bars end (valid if
; mixer timing bars are in use).
MIXER_DEFAULT_COLOUR	EQU	$000

; Set define below to 1 to enable CIA based timing of the performance of the
; interrupt handler. This uses the CIA-A timer.
;
; Note: this option should not be enabled if the mixer option 
;       MIXER_EXTERNAL_IRQ_DMA has been enabled and the mixer has been set up
;       to run using the OS's interrupt mechanism.
MIXER_CIA_TIMER			EQU 0
; Set define below to 1 to enable restoring the keyboard for OS use after
; using CIA based performance timing. Has no function if MIXER_CIA_TIMER is
; set to 0.
MIXER_CIA_KBOARD_RES	EQU	1

; Set define below to 1 to enable the mixer interrupt counter. This word sized
; counter increases by one every time the mixer interrupt has been executed
; and can be accessed using the routines MixerResetCounter() and
; MixerGetCounter()
MIXER_COUNTER			EQU 0


;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Advanced options
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Set define below to 1 to enable the use of callback functions. If enabled, 
; whenever a sample ends playing back, the mixer will check if a callback 
; function has been configured. If so, the callback function will be called.
;
; If the define is set to 0, callback functions can't be used.
; 
; Note: enabling callback functions slightly increases CPU cost of the mixer
;       when a sample ends.
MIXER_ENABLE_CALLBACK	EQU 0

; Set define below to enable plugins. Plugins are real time effect routines
; that are called by the mixer prior to the mixing of a given mixer channel.
; They can be enabled or disabled per channel and when active output sample 
; data into an output buffer which is used by the mixer for further 
; processing.
;
; Note: enabling plugins slightly increases CPU and memory costs of the mixer
;       for all mixer channels playing back samples. In addition, the effects
;       routines themselves will also add CPU overhead.
MIXER_ENABLE_PLUGINS	EQU 0

; Set define below to enable the return vector. The return vector is a user
; specified routine that will be called at the end of audio interrupt
; processing.
;
; Note: enabling the return vector slightly increases CPU overhead during
;       interrupt processing.
MIXER_ENABLE_RETURN_VECTOR	EQU 0

; Set define below to 1 to change the mixer such that it no longer uses its
; built-in interrupt handler and DMACON handling, but rather uses callbacks to
; deal with these aspects. These callback can be set up by calling the routine
; MixerSetupIRQDMACallbacks().
;
; Note: the primary purpose of this setting is to allow external engines/API's
;       to have control over interrupts and DMA flags. This feature can also
;       be used to create an OS-legal interrupt handler.
; Note: enabling this feature also makes the mixer interrupt handler end in
;       RTS, rather than RTE, to facilitate incorporating the mixer interrupt
;       handler in an external one. It is up to these external routines to
;       make sure the mixer's interrupt handler is called once per audio 
;       interrupt on enabled channels.
; Note: enabling this feature disables the MIXER_CIA_TIMER setting.
; Note: enabling callback functions slightly increases CPU cost of the mixer.
MIXER_EXTERNAL_IRQ_DMA	EQU 0

; Set define below to 1 to change the mixer such that calls to the external
; interrupt and DMA handling routines calls these once per bit to be set, 
; rather than providing a full mask containing all relevant bits in one call.
;
; Note: this feature only has an effect if MIXER_EXTERNAL_IRQ_DMA is set to 1.
MIXER_EXTERNAL_BITWISE	EQU 0

; Set define below to 1 to revert the mixer's behaviour when 
; MIXER_EXTERNAL_IRQ_DMA is set to 1 to using an RTE to end the interrupt
; interrupt, rather than an RTS.
;
; Note: this feature only has an effect if MIXER_EXTERNAL_IRQ_DMA is set to 1.
MIXER_EXTERNAL_RTE		EQU	0

; Set define below to 1 to include the mixer in section code,code.
; If set to 0, the mixer will not be set a specific section (normally this is
; not needed, but it can be useful in certain cases)
MIXER_SECTION			EQU	1

; Set define below to 1 if the assembler used does not support the "echo"
; command. This blocks mixer.asm displaying messages during assembly.
MIXER_NO_ECHO			EQU 0

; Set define below to 1 to include C style function definition aliases in
; addition to the standard function definitions. This effectively creates
; a number of XDEF _<FunctionName> symbols for use in linking against C based
; code.
;
; Note: enabling this option also changes the way plugins and callbacks are
;       handled, so that they can deal with the registers that C compilers can
;       trash between function calls.
